## Sudoku Game (C++ / wxWidgets)
A feature-rich Sudoku game implemented in C++ with wxWidgets, designed as part of a team project for an Object-Oriented Design class. This project demonstrates advanced OOP principles, design patterns, and large-scale software organization.

### Overview
-   Three sudoku puzzles with interactive gameplay mechanics 
	-   “Eat” numbers scattered on the board using a school mascot character
	-   Store numbers in the mascot’s tummy and “regurgitate” them onto the Sudoku grid 
	-   Limited number storage and timer-based challenges
	-   Solve button if stuck on a level for too long

This project was originally developed as part of a team-based Object-Oriented Design course, but the repository showcases the core game logic, architecture, and documentation authored independently.
